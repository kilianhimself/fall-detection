Fall Detection readme

Fall Detection is a solution based on a Pebble Smartwatch and an Android phone to recognize a fall of the person wearing the smartwatch and to trigger an SMS based alert to defined phone numbers. These alerts also include the current location of the user.
It consists of two applications, a Pebble App and the related companion app for Android.
